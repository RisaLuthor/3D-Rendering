Glasses:
<br><p> Eyeglasses without a traditional frame around the lenses. Instead of having a frame that encircles the lenses, these glasses use small screws or a wire to connect the lenses directly to the temples and nose bridge. This design gives the illusion of the lenses floating on the wearer's face, providing a minimalist and lightweight aesthetic. Frameless glasses are popular for their sleek and modern appearance, making them a fashionable choice for individuals seeking a subtle and contemporary eyewear style. They are often preferred for their comfort, versatility, and unobtrusive look, making them suitable for various occasions and outfit styles. </p>
