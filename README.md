3D rendering involves the creation of realistic or artistic two-dimensional images or animations from a three-dimensional model using computer software. It simulates lighting, textures, shadows, and other visual effects to produce lifelike representations of objects or scenes. This technology is widely used in various industries such as architecture, gaming, film production, product design, and advertising to visualize concepts and create immersive visual experiences.

Glasses:
<br><p> Eyeglasses without a traditional frame around the lenses. Instead of having a frame that encircles the lenses, these glasses use small screws or a wire to connect the lenses directly to the temples and nose bridge. This design gives the illusion of the lenses floating on the wearer's face, providing a minimalist and lightweight aesthetic. Frameless glasses are popular for their sleek and modern appearance, making them a fashionable choice for individuals seeking a subtle and contemporary eyewear style. They are often preferred for their comfort, versatility, and unobtrusive look, making them suitable for various occasions and outfit styles. </p>
